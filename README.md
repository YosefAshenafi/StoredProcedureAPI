# Stored Procedure API

## Overview
This project aims to expose stored procedures as API endpoints, enabling seamless integration with mobile and other applications. By simply updating or creating stored procedures (SPs), developers can access them via API endpoints without additional backend implementation, reducing development time and complexity.

## Features
- Automatic API generation for stored procedures.
- Simplified backend management.
- Supports multiple applications (mobile, web, etc.).
- Secure and efficient data handling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stored-procedure-api.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd stored-procedure-api
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # If using Node.js
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   dotnet restore  # If using .NET
   ```
4. Set up your database connection in the configuration file.

## Usage
1. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start  # For Node.js
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   dotnet run  # For .NET
   ```
2. Access the API:
   ```sh
   GET /api/procedure-name?param1=value1&param2=value2
   ```
3. Call the API from your mobile or web application.

## Configuration
Ensure you configure database credentials in the `.env` file (for Node.js) or `appsettings.json` (for .NET).
